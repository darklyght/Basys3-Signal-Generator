# EE2020-Signal-Generator

Signal generator in Verilog HDL for Basys3 for EE2020.

Sinusoidal wave employs the Xilinx CORDIC core. However, a look-up table is also included. Edit the code to use the look-up table if IP core is not available.

This project was completed as part of the module EE2020 Digital Fundamentals. The code is incomplete and may never be completed. Use it as a reference but please note that nothing here has been optimised for any purpose.
